Roguelike-Game
==============

This one is made in Common Lisp. The thing is: there are two ways to play it! Fully automazed, or manually :) Enjoy!

If you are playing manually: 
  To change the position input "w", "a", "s" or "d";
  To spend spell points input "sp", than choose from 1 to 3 in order to improve HP, MP, Luck;
  To attack in fight input "att", to defence - "def", to flee - "flee", to use food - "u food";
  To quit the game input "q";
  
If you want to start an automazed game, then do what the comments say :)
